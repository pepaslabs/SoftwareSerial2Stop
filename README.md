# SoftwareSerial2Stop

A fork of the Arduino SoftwareSerial which is hard-coded to use 2 stop bits.

This is useful for interfacing with the HP 34401A, which requires 2 stop bits.

The `demo/` folder includes a sketch which implements an external LCD
display for the HP 34401A.  See also https://gist.github.com/cellularmitosis/1582236f226e9d98075a0c971eb4168c
